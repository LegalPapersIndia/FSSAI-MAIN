            Food safety is extremely important because it directly impacts
            public health. In India, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of
            India (FSSAI) ensures that food consumed by the public meets safety
            and quality standards. Because of its importance in the food
            industry, many businesses and individuals have questions regarding
            FSSAI regulations, licensing, and compliance.
